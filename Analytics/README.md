# SETUP
This is a brief rundown of how I set up my machines to clone and edit the Github repo.

Feel free to use something else, but this way is very easy and convenient.

## Resources
Download latest version of GIT

Download latest version of Visual Studio Code

## Steps 
- Open your terminal (Windows or linux doesn't matter)
- Input the following:
```
git configure --global user.name "[your github name]"
    
git configure --global user.email "[your github email]"
```
- Without these things configured Git gets mad
- Once VSCode is installed, install the Github Repositories extension
    (far left hand side, should be the 4th icon down)
- Press CTRL + SHFT + P to open the search menu
- Search for "Git:clone"
- Follow the steps to sign into Github and connect it to your account in the browser
- Connect this repo to VSCode 
- Open the repository

# CURRENT PLANS
tableTranslation.py is not yet done, the plan is for that script to do the brunt of the translation.
    
We may break the data into two files:

- one for the class setup

- one for the professors, and their connected classes

We can then potentially use another script to input the translated data and input it to a .sql file.
