# TABLES
Provided by Professor Demland

# NOTES
These tables are the cumulative data of various tables given to us by Demland. 

- There are 2 sheets in this document, one for on-ground classes, and one for online classes.  
	- Toggle between them at the bottom
- All empty cells have been replaced with "--" to cooperate with the conversion script
	- if this is ever an issue you can use ctrl+h and replace "--" with nothing
- I got rid of as many duplicate rows as I could, but its possible that there are some that persist

You shouldn't need to edit this, its simply here so that everyone has it.
