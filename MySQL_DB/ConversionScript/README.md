# FYI:
1. The configuration of the content in the source spreadsheet matters a lot in how well this script works. Any empty cells will throw an error. Additionally, so do NULL values (currently set to "-").
2. The script assumes you've followed the directions of the installation guide: ["Adding the Database"](../README.md#Adding-the-Database) & ["Using the Conversion Script"](../README.md#Using-the-Conversion-Script).
